A document containing output I produced during my time here


## Objectives
1. Create a mini version of their entire system

## System monitoring
> Start from the problems I face
- Worry about system components going off the rails for discernable reason at face value
> **Sauce**: [See holy shit part of the issue comment](https://github.com/MarcusOngKianSiong/personal_website_backend_python/issues/3#issuecomment-2413028147)
>> I wasted so much time trying to discern the problem by changing the things within the scope I was operating, when the problem is not within that scope.
>> I want to know if the source of the problem is within or out of scope instantly.
>>
>> 
>> **Solution**: Display state of expected system components.
>>> **Explanation**: If the states are OK, and there is a problem, it means that the source is beyond the scope of my knowledge. Therefore, I can skip the "changing things within scope" part and get straight to figuring out what I am missing.

## Is there any way to simulate the data coming in?
